This repository is based on the following project: The Odin Project | Fundamentals Course | Landing Page

## Goals
For this project I had to creating an entire web page from a design that was provided to me. The design provided came in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors that should be used. 

Learning goals: 
* Setup a website from scratch
* Use flex to create a fluid webpage
* Integrate css and aim towards target design 
* Be creative in the content that is displayed on the webpage
* Become more familiar with github
* Research missing information
